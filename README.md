Hellooo checking

for bcrypt gem to work:

1) gemfile, gem bcrypt, you  need to run $bundle installl
2) db/migrate, you need password_digest
3) app/models/user.rb, you need "has_secure_password"


#Sinatra Web Server
## Repo details
| Details   |  |
| :--------------- | -------: |
| Re-created by: | Holloway, Chew Kean Ho |
| Version:    | 0.0.9   |
| Contribution:    | Hobby. Best effort basis.   |
<br><br>
## Purpose
This Ruby Sinatra web skeleton was re-furbished for rapid prototyping a web API before deploying to rails server. It's referenced from Rails file structure with mild tweaking and CodeDivision Sinatra skeleton.
<br><br>
##Supports
1. Local Support
2. Heroku Support - using PUMA
3. Bluemix Support - using PUMA
4. Cloud9 Support - using Shotgun

>**NOTE**:
>This guide assumes you are good with Ruby, Heroku, Bluemix and understands MVC architecture patterns.

# To go for platform specific code, please visit these pages:
1. Heroku - https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server/tree/heroku
2. Bluemix - https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server/tree/bluemix
3. Cloud9 - continue to read README.

# Master Branch
> Master branch currently based on Heroku platform. Please use with caution.

<br><br>
## Common Setup
1) Perform a git clone to this repo using the following link:
```
# http
$ git clone https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server.git
# ssh
$ git clone git@github.com:hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server.git

# Heroku Platform
$ git clone -b heroku https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server.git

# Bluemix Platform
$ git clone -b bluemix https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/sinatra-web-server.git
```
2)  Rename the skeleton if needed
```
$ mv sinatra-web-server <your-desired-app-name>
```
3) Enter into the skeleton and perform bundle install
```
$ cd <your-desired-app-name>
$ bundle install
# Open issue in this github repo if any issue
```
4) Perform a short test by launching the server
```
$ rake server
```
If you're working on cloud9 server, you should use the following command:
```
$ rake c9-server
```

5) Hooray! You may now begin your code development.
<br><br>

## How To Use
The skeleton is primarily based on Rails file structure with focus towards MVC architectural pattern. However, unlike Rails, this skeleton is to provide more structural freedom for you to prototype or to bootstrap and idea quickly. The flexibility is up to deploying the SaaS platform.
<br>
### To Launch the Server
Rakefile has a simplified command for launching the server in development mode. To perform, execute:
```
$ rake server
```
<br><br>

### To Include/Remove a Gem
1) Include/remove your gem inside Gemfile depending on group.
```
# File location: <repo_root>\Gemfile
```
2) Perform bundle install
```
$ bundle install
```
3) Head to **config\environments\init.rb** to ensure your require is aligned to your adjustment.
```
# Perform requiring gem that we need
#######################################################
	# basic
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup' if File.exists?(ENV['BUNDLE_GEMFILE'])
require 'pathname'

	# database
require 'pg'
require 'active_record'
require 'logger'

	# sinatra
require 'sinatra'
require "sinatra/reloader" if development?

	# embedded ruby
require 'erb'
require 'uri'

	# Additional Gem includes after this comments
#######################################################
```
4) Done. You're ready.
<br><br>

### To Create Controller
You can create a controller ruby file inside **app/controllers** manually. As long as there is no conflicted routes, you can create many controller files. Sinatra go through each controller file and compile all available route.

In this example, let's create 'sessions' routing:
```
# app/controllers/users.rb

get '/signup' do
	erb :'users/new'
end

post '/signup' do
	# Do something processing with user input
	redirect to '/user/dashboard'
end

get '/user/dashboard' do
	erb :dashboard
end
```
<br>
### To Create Views
You can create a view erb file inside **app/views** manually. This framework uses erb gem to generate the view. Views can be created in full-form or partial-form. Examples,
#### To create simple erb view file:
```
# app/views/root.erb
<h1>This is root page</h1>
...
# To route it, use ' erb :root ' in controller
```
#### To create erb view file inside a sub-folder:
```
# app/views/users/new.erb
<h1>This is signup page</h1>
...
# To route it, use ' erb :"users/new" ' in controller
```
#### To create partial erb view file:
```
# app/views/partials/form.erb
<h1>This is partial forms for AJAX calls</h1>
...


# To use it in existing view .erb file, example:
	# in app/views/users/new.erb
	<h2> User Data </h2>
	<%= erb :"partial/form" %>
```
<br><br>

### To Create Model
Model creation is supported by Rakefile. To create, simply execute:
```
$ rake generate:model NAME=<singular_model_name>
```
>**NOTE**:
> Due to maintaining structural freedom, rake will only create model file and **not** with database migration file. You're expected to handle database migration file separately.

<br><br>

### To Create Helper
Helper file can be created inside **app/helpers** manually and at will. To ensure the functions are working in the helpers, any helper file should has the helpers loop. Example:
```
# app/helpers/html.rb
helpers do
	# for repetitive <em> in html view
	def em(param)
		...
	end

	# for repetitive math calculation
	def calculate_square(param)
		param * param
	end

	# More repetitive functions
	...
end
```
<br>
Any function within helpers loop can be called directly like a Ruby modules' methods. Example:
```
# app/controllers/root.rb
post '/' do
	calculate_square(params[:input])
end

# app/views/root.erb
<html>
	...
	<%= em("String") %>
	...
</html>
```

<br><br>

### To Create Database
Database creation is supported by Rakefile. To create, execute:
```
$ rake db:create
```
<br><br>

### To Create Database Migration File
Database migration file creation is supported by Rakefile. To create, execute:
```
$ rake generate:migration NAME=<filename>
```
>**REMEMBER**:
>------be careful with ActiveRecord **naming convention** especially singular/plural!

<br><br>

### To Perform Database Migration
Database migration is supported by Rakefile. To perform, execute:
```
$ rake db:migrate
```
<br><br>

### To Drop Database
Database migration is supported by Rakefile. To perform, execute:
```
$ rake db:drop
```
<br><br>

### To Seed Data into Database
Database data seeding is supported by Rakefile. To perform, execute:
```
$ rake db:seed
```
<br><br>

### To View Current Database Migration Version
Database current migration version view is supported by Rakefile. To perform, execute:
```
$ rake db:version
```
